ADB &amp; Fastboot GUI/wrapper. Optimized for Google Pixel devices, but works great with any USB Debuggable android device.

Sorry about the spaghetti code. Source has also been stripped of proprietary adb binaries, so if youre building from source you're gonna need platform-tools from google.

1. You need to enable USB debugging to be able to use this.
2. You probably will need .net 6.0 runtimes.
